Students writing connects them to their families and communities in diverse and creative ways. Families can support and provide experiences for their children to write about, and they themselves can participate in the story process by being storytellers or audiences. Children love to listen to stories, sharing time and family history with the parent or grandparent who tells them. Listening to these stories, children learn the structure of narratives and the many ways of relating meaningful and engaging thoughts and events.Middle school teacher Priscilla Kelly (1993) relates how allowing her students to tell their families stories inspired not only their writing, but wide-ranging research projects:The first time I assigned the biographies I envisioned students researching a notable person, probably someone unrelated to themselves. You can imagine my surprise when at least two-thirds of the class chose to write about members of their own families. I was horrified since each student presents a twenty-minute oral report about her biographical subject. How many grandmothers could we stand to hear about! How wrong I was. First, I was and continue to be amazed at the relatives that my students have. They come with stories that amaze, complete with documentation in old pictures, diaries, awards. I ask them to read at least one book that will familiarize them with the context of their subjects life.
